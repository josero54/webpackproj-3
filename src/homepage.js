        <h2>Signature Cocktails</h2>
        <p>Our bar crafts libations that embody the spirit of our fusion cuisine. Sip on a Mediterranean Mojito, where cool mint meets aromatic rosewater, or indulge in our Aegean Rum Punch, a potent blend that marries Caribbean rums with the sophisticated finish of Greek Metaxa.</p>
